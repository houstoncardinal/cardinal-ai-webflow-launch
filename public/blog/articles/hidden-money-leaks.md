# The Hidden Money Leaks on Your Website (and How to Plug Them)

Most business owners think: "I have a website, so I'm good."

But here's the truth: your website is probably leaking money every single day—and you don't even know it.

## The 5 Critical Money Leaks in Your Website

### 1. The Silent Phone Problem
If your phone number isn't clickable on mobile, you're losing calls.

**Quick Fix**: Make it one tap to call. It sounds small, but it can be the difference between 10 calls a month and 100.

### 2. The Invisible Offer
Your best service or product is buried deep in your site. Most visitors never see it.

**Quick Fix**: Put your #1 money-maker right on the homepage with a big button.

### 3. The 24/7 Black Hole
Your website has no way to capture leads when you're asleep. Visitors leave, and you never even know they were there.

**Quick Fix**: Add a simple lead form or chatbot. Even one extra lead per week could mean thousands in extra revenue per year.

### 4. The Trust Gap
No reviews. No testimonials. No social proof. Customers wonder: "Can I trust this business?"

**Quick Fix**: Put real client reviews front and center. People trust other people more than your sales pitch.

### 5. The Slow-Death Scroll
Your site takes 5+ seconds to load. Most visitors are gone by then.

**Quick Fix**: Speed up your site. Every second you save can raise conversions by up to 7%.

## The Key Insight

A website isn't just a digital business card. It's a 24/7 salesperson. If yours isn't set up to capture attention, build trust, and drive action—you're leaving money on the table.

### Transform Your Website into Your Best Salesperson

Think about it: If your website was your best salesperson, how would you want them to act? 
- Confident in presenting your solutions?
- Clear in communicating value?
- Persuasive in driving action?

Your website needs to embody these qualities to truly serve your business.
