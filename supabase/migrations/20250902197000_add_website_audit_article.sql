  '# The 10-Minute Website Audit That Can Save You Thousands

Most business owners never check these basics â€” and it costs them leads every single day.

## Quick Website Audit Checklist

Here''s a quick DIY audit you can do in 10 minutes:

### 1. Page Speed Performance

Your first impression matters. Run your site through [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). If it''s slow, customers bounce.

**Impact**: Each second delay = 7% fewer conversions

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness

Over 60% of visitors are on mobile. If your site isn''t responsive, you''re invisible to most potential customers.

**Key Check**: Test your site on multiple devices and screen sizes.

### 3. SSL Certificate Security

Without proper HTTPS security:
* Google lowers your ranking
* Customers don''t trust your site
* You risk losing sensitive data

### 4. Strategic CTA Placement

Is your "Call Now" or "Contact" button visible without scrolling?

**Pro Tip**: Your main call-to-action should be visible within 3 seconds of landing on your page.

### 5. Link Integrity Check

Test all your main pages for broken links. A single broken link can:
* Hurt user trust
* Damage SEO rankings
* Lose potential customers

## Bonus Power-Up: Live Chat Integration

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Add live chat or a click-to-text option on mobile. It can double leads overnight.

### Why This Works:
* Instant engagement with visitors
* 24/7 lead capture
* Lower barrier to entry than phone calls
* Better conversion rates than contact forms
